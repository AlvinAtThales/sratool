# SRA Tool - Software Security Risk Assessment Tool  - <b>Version 1.0.0</b>

The Security  Risk Assessment Tool provides  a structured, repeatable method 
for evaluating the potential security risk on a Software Project and recommends appropriate security activities.
Risk Rating Methodology can be customized - Questionaires and Multiple Opption Answers with specific Wieghts and Scores -
<br/>The Default SRA Method used is the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology

## License
  SRA Tool is distributed under the <a href="https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/rmundome/sratool/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT License.</a>


### The Project has two main components:<br/> 
 - SRA API Service
 - SRA Web UI
    
## To Install and used :
***Implementation can be done on Windows/Linux platforms

### For SRA Tool - API Service 

  <b>a) Install Prerequisites</b><br/>
    - Golang ( Service - Backend is written in this language )<br/>
    - MySQL Server <br/>
    - Go MySQL Drivers<br/><br/>
The file sra.config.json contains the initial configuration to connect to the Database<br/>
the file Main.go contains sets the API listener to 127.0.0.1 (localhost)<br/><br/>
The API structure and flow can be follow checking : main.go - > routes.go -> handlers.go -> sra_models.go<br/>

<b>b) go get (to install the Go dependencies)</b><br/>
<b>c) go build (To build the executable that serves the API</b><br/>
<b>d) run the executable </b><br/>
<b>e) Test http(s)://127.0.0.1:7089/sra/projects (Port and Address modifiable on file main.go)</b><br/>

### For SRA Tool - Web UI
  <b>a) Install Prerequisites</b><br/>
    - Angular (Web App uses Angular 1.2 )<br/> 
    - Angular-formly-templates-ionic (see WebUI/js/formly/*.txt)<br/>    
    - Angular Datatables and Datables  (see WebUI/js/angularDatatables/*.txt and WebUI/js/Datatables/*.txt)<br/> 
    - Angular Loading Bar (see WebUI/js/loadingbar/*.txt)<br/>
    - Angular-nvd3 (see WebUI/js/angular-nvd3/*.txt) <br/>
    
    b) Set the WebServer of your preference (e.g. IIS on Windows or Apache on Linux) and create a new Website.
    c) Point the Newly created website to the SRA Tool - Web UI directory and set index.html as the initial document
    d) Test  http(s)://127.0.0.1/sra



### Security considerations
The SRA Tool was written with a particular deployment scenario in mind: single server/VM hosting and running on an internal LAN (e.g. a corporate network not exposed to the public internet). 
Also, no identity management, user authentication, or role-based access controls have yet been implemented for the applications.
It is suggested that Webservers hosting the tool implement TLS and Authentication and Authorization mechanisms (security standards - To be leveraged by system administrators/implementators ) 



## Security Issues
Security issues with the tool itself can be reported to Intel's security incident response team via https://intel.com/security.
